### Day 0: July 21, 2023

**Today's Progress:** 
1. Initialized Repo on Github & updated log/rules pages. 
2. Reviewed JavaScript concepts on freeCodeCamp as a refresher for future projects going forward. This includes: 
    Basic JS concepts - operators, compound assignment, escaping characters, concatenation, manipulating arrays, functions (global and local scope), switch statements & if else chains, objects & their properties, lookups, iteration & loops, conditionals & multiple conditionals, recursion.

**Thoughts:** Working with primarily C# in my professional career, I find it valuable working with JavaScript - a non-scrictly-typed language. Today's refresher was useful for preparing for future personal projects using JS and JS frameworks. Nothing I'm unfamiliar with or don't remember, but good to practice regardless. Gotta stay sharp!
