### Day 0: July 21, 2023

**Today's Progress:** 
1. Initialized Repo on Github & updated log/rules pages. 
2. Reviewed JavaScript concepts on freeCodeCamp as a refresher for future projects going forward. This includes: 
    Basic JS concepts - operators, compound assignment, escaping characters, concatenation, manipulating arrays, functions (global and local scope), switch statements & if else chains, objects & their properties, lookups, iteration & loops, conditionals & multiple conditionals, recursion.

**Thoughts:** Working with primarily C# in my professional career, I find it valuable working with JavaScript - a non-scrictly-typed language. Today's refresher was useful for preparing for future personal projects using JS and JS frameworks. Nothing I'm unfamiliar with or don't remember, but good to practice regardless. Gotta stay sharp!

### Day 1: July 24, 2023

**Today's Progress:**
1. Determine Project outline
2. Initialize new repo, connect to Github & update log page. 

**Thoughts:** After 2 days reviewing JavaScript concepts, I've decided my first project will be a Dashboard application. I will start with a to-do list feature that can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. With time, I will improve the application with new features: weather widget, and quote widget. May progess to adding a spotify player. May also implement into a browser extension - we'll see how it goes. This will help showcase my ability to build modular & expandable applications.

### Day 2: July 25, 2023

**Today's Progress:**
1. After deciding on the project objective, I planned the project tasks and milestones. This timeline currently includes 3 features to implement - the To-Do list, the Weather widget, and the Quote of the Day widget. These will be my milestones. 
2. Tasks breakdown currently focuses on the To-Do list. I started with planning, designing, and creating tasks for the dashboard layout first. 

**Thoughts:** Day 2, and I'm starting with a great project plan. I'm really excited to visualize this concept, and get started on building it. I feel confident this is a great concept and project to have on my resume and portfolio.

### Day 3: July 26, 2023

**Today's Progress:**
1. After coming across an EJS tutorial, I decided I wanted to learn & implement it into this project. Its a great way to combine my vanilla JS knowledge into embedded JS w/ HTML templates. EJS is most often used to generate dynamic HTML content on the server-side, and particularly popular in Node.js and Express.js applications. 
2. I've begun re-writing and organizing the application file structure and code to implement EJS going forward. 

**Thoughts:** Day 3 was a long day of replacing the codebase I had with EJS funcitonality. However, I'm really enjoying the way EJS works and developing with it alongside Node and Express. I'm excited to get everything plugged in and working so I can get to the styling.

### Day 4: July 27, 2023

**Today's Progress:**
1. Continued building out application mobility and funcitonality. 
2. Minor styling, will enhance later. 

**Thoughts:** I've spent much more time on coding in previous days. Today was a light session but some days, it's good to have that. I'm happy with the momentum I'm buildling.

### Day 5: July 28, 2023

1. Worked on site design and color scheme. 
2. Wireframed the login and home pages - including module placement for to-do's & quote, as well as header & footer. 
3. Started coding some styling changes, minor update

**Thoughts:** This first week is going well. I've really envisioned a picture of this application that I can be proud of and enjoy. I look forward to getting more work done.

### Day 7: August 1, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Forgot to log this day! But I *did* commit my changes in my Quickdash app. Minor content & stlying update.

**Thoughts:** This day wasn't as long - considering I needed to run to my partner's place to help start the packing.

### Day 8: August 4, 2023

**Today's Progress:** 2 days off while I was moving my partner out of his old apartment and into the new one.
1. More templating 
2. Content & Stlying - basics, wrapping up

**Thoughts:** I'm EXHAUSTED. 2+ days of moving and packing and unpacking - only 2 days after helping move my friends into their new home, too. This week - physically, it took its toll. But mentally, I'm itching to get my momentum back up on this quickdash project.

### Day 9: August 5, 2023

**Today's Progress:** 
1. The follow-along video (I should have linked it in the log sooner...) I'm using for EJS templating was reviewing minor customization - element & :hover styling.
2. Got distracted on the :hover animations and dove into that for the day. 

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to be working on code daily again. The community on twitter has been very supportive and encouraging, which I enjoy.

1. Adjustments to content display 
2. Focusing app functionality - potentially moving onto auth

### Day 11: August 7, 2023 

**Today's Progress:** 
1. Focus on completing Login Page Content

**Thoughts:** Focusing on sections of the application at a time (aka, login page, auth, routing, home, etc.) makes it easier to mentally compartmentalize this process.

### Day 12: August 8, 2023

**Today's Progress:** 
1. Finished Login Page content. Moving onto next steps

**Thoughts:** The tutorial isn't organizing the application building process the way I would personally, so I'm learning to be flexible when learning from someone else.
