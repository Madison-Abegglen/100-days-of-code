### Day 0: July 21, 2023

**Today's Progress:** 
1. Initialized Repo on Github & updated log/rules pages. 
2. Reviewed JavaScript concepts on freeCodeCamp as a refresher for future projects going forward. This includes: 
    Basic JS concepts - operators, compound assignment, escaping characters, concatenation, manipulating arrays, functions (global and local scope), switch statements & if else chains, objects & their properties, lookups, iteration & loops, conditionals & multiple conditionals, recursion.

**Thoughts:** Working with primarily C# in my professional career, I find it valuable working with JavaScript - a non-scrictly-typed language. Today's refresher was useful for preparing for future personal projects using JS and JS frameworks. Nothing I'm unfamiliar with or don't remember, but good to practice regardless. Gotta stay sharp!

### Day 1: July 24, 2023

**Today's Progress:**
1. Determine Project outline. Initialize new repo, connect to Github & update log page. 

**Thoughts:** After 2 days reviewing JavaScript concepts, I've decided my first project will be a Dashboard application. I will start with a to-do list feature that can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. With time, I will improve the application with new features: weather widget, and quote widget. May progess to adding a spotify player. May also implement into a browser extension - we'll see how it goes. This will help showcase my ability to build modular & expandable applications.

### Day 2: July 25, 2023

**Today's Progress:**
1. After deciding on the project objective, I planned the project tasks and milestones. This timeline currently includes 3 features to implement - the To-Do list, the Weather widget, and the Quote of the Day widget. These will be my milestones. Tasks breakdown currently focuses on the To-Do list. I started with planning, designing, and creating tasks for the dashboard layout first. 

**Thoughts:** Day 2, and I'm starting with a great project plan. I'm really excited to visualize this concept, and get started on building it. I feel confident this is a great concept and project to have on my resume and portfolio.
